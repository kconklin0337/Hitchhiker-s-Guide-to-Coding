Reflect:
    1. What is the best thing about class for you thus far? Being able to be creative and further what i know, breaking my code and fixing it, and breaking it again, just so i can understand what it is.
    2. What would happen if you made an <h7> tag in a webpage? It would look the same as h6, h6 is the highest you can go!
    3. How would you describe html to a middle school kid? It makes the facebook look good.

Review: Describe each of the following:
       1. H1: is header 1 which is the biggest font header.
       2. H3: is smaller then 1 and 2, but it is a header itself.
       3. li: sets up a list
       4. ul: unordered list, which has bullets
       5. ol: ordered list. which has numbers instead of bullets.
       6. Span: hide a codes or codes and give a simple looking text or video
       7. div: standard way to layout a page
       8. em: emphasis the text in italics.
       9. strong: bolds the words
       10. p: is a paragraph
