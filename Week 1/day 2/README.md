Reflect:
    1. How do you feel about your first webpage? Excited! I was able to tell the internets exactly what to say! Can't wait to be able to give it some style coding!
    2. What was the most difficult aspect of creating the html page? Spelling and special character punctuations and proper placements.
    3. What, if anything, do you still have questions about? What exactly does node do when it goes get files and downloads them.

Review:
    1. What is DOCTYPE? It is the type of coding being used.
    2. What is the difference between the <head> and the <body>? <head> is the main title of the page and <body> is a description of the page which can include pictures, text or any code inside.
