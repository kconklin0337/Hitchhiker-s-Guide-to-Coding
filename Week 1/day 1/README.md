Reflect: First day of class was a great introductory to git and was a nice to get to know everyone.
        My style of learning is borne of determination and moving at a fast pace to learn as much as I can without wasting time!
Review: git status tells the status of the folders and files.
        git add watches the folder
        git add puts it on github
        cd is change directory
        ls list what is in the current folder
        mkdir makes a directory
        touch adds a text file.
