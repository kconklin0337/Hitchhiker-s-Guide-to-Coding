Reflect:
        1. What was the most frustrating thing about today? Leaving my original brain circle.
        2. Why do you think that good code conventions are in place? To keep things organized and structured properly.
        3. How would you describe the box model to someone that has never seen a computer? Your skin is the body of a "webpage" and the area between your skin and your shirt the margin separating the text and the sides of the screen.
Review:
        1. List all of the errors that you found today: Misspelled words, indentions, codes with wrong attributes like navnavdiv
        2. How would you make sure that you do not suffer through what we did today? I did not suffer at all, but I do need to stop working on my own webpage during class.
        3. What is padding? Padding gives it space between what's above, below, and each sides.
        4. What is margin? Marin declares when the next line can start.
        5. What does the following do?
        a:hover{
          background-color:#FFF
        }
          It changes the color over an anchor when the mouse hovers over it
