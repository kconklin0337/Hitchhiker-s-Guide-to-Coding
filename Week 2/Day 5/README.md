        1. What else would you like to be able to do when creating your web applications? Currently I am working on getting the nav bar fixed inside a background of it's own separate from the main page background. Getting the table to properly fix itself without messing up the border.
        2. How do you think you are going to keep the different languages JS, CSS, and HTML straight? I would keep JS and CSS at the top of the page and use proper indentions where i can see where it starts and where it ends. I would only use the html in the actual body.

Review:
       1. How do you select a paragraph and make the text color "light-salmon"? In html you would do <!-- <font color="light salmon"></font> --> for css it would be something like font.salmon <!-- {font color="light salmon"}; <font class="salmon">-->
       2. What is the difference between inline and internal stlyes? inline styling is put the code over and over where you want it to be make making a huge mess. Internal styling is making a code for what you are trying to do at the very top and having a short hand version of the code where you wish it to be placed.
       3. What will the following CSS styling do?
        <!--  h1 {
                 font-family:"Comic Sans MS";
                 background-color:chartrues;
          } -->
          It will assign a font character and a color to where ever <h1> is placed!
