        1. You have learned three different languages up until this point, which one is the easiest to you: HTML, CSS, or JS.. Why? CSS, it's pretty straight forward.
        2. We have just touched on HTML, CSS, and JS, what was the most difficult concept of these three to you? Being able to grab a hold of all elements. Ran into syntax erros. JS seems to be a little more sensitive then the other coding languages.
        3. What is a site that you could build with your skills up until this point? Overstack, CSschool.

        1. I need to grab a button, whith the id 'clicky' and the classes 'btnbtn-default', to the styling when the button is clicked. Which one of the JS selector functions would you use? GetElementById
        2. What are some of the events that you can 'listen' for and respond to with the DOM elements? console.log , function Blah
        3. What is provided to you when you use the GetElementById? all elements define by an id which is usually one
           How is this different from getElementByClass? class is a little more breathing room letting you select thing(s) with that class, that could be multipul
